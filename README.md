# DL_project

## Prerequisites
1. **Python Installation**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook by running `pip install notebook` if not already installed.
3. **Dependencies**: Each `.ipynb` file requires pytorch and scikit-learn. Install them using:
    ```bash
    pip install pytorch
    pip install scikit-learn
    ```

## Steps to Execute `.ipynb` Files
1. **Navigate to the Directory**:
    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `.ipynb` files:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/notebooks
    ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    Start the Jupyter Notebook server by running:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a web interface in your default browser.

3. **Open the Notebook**:
    In the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate and click on the desired `.ipynb` file to open it.

4. **Run the Notebook**:
    - Execute each cell sequentially by clicking the "Run" button or pressing `Shift + Enter`.
    - Ensure that all cells are executed in order to reproduce the experiments correctly.

5. **Verify Outputs**:
    Compare the outputs generated by the notebook with the expected results (if provided) to confirm successful reproduction of the experiments.

## Notes
- If the notebook relies on external datasets or files, ensure they are placed in the correct directory as specified in the notebook.
- For reproducibility, consider using a virtual environment or containerized setup (e.g., Docker) to isolate dependencies.
- If any errors occur, refer to the error messages and ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
